// Package xds contains an implementation of the xDS suite of protocols, to be
// used by gRPC client and server applications.
//
// On the client-side, users simply need to import this package to get all xDS
// functionality. On the server-side, users need to use the GRPCServer type
// exported by this package instead of the regular grpc.Server.
//
// See https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/tree/master/examples/features/xds for
// example.
package xds

import (
	_ "google.golang.org/grpc/credentials/tls/certprovider/pemfile" // Register the file watcher certificate provider plugin.
	_ "google.golang.org/grpc/xds/internal/balancer"                // Register the balancers.
	_ "google.golang.org/grpc/xds/internal/client/v2"               // Register the v2 xDS API client.
	_ "google.golang.org/grpc/xds/internal/client/v3"               // Register the v3 xDS API client.
	_ "google.golang.org/grpc/xds/internal/resolver"                // Register the xds_resolver.
