This directory contains the implementation of the xDS and LRS clients and is
not meant for direct use. It's under active development and may change
significantly. There are no API stability guarantees at this time.

If you are looking for a way to interact with xDS, please refer to the
[example](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/blob/master/examples/features/xds/README.md).
