	// the resource received from the xDS server or an error indicating the
	// reason why the resource could not be obtained.
	//
	// In the former case, this callback will be invoked with a non-nil
	// ResourceData in ResourceDataOrError. The ResourceData of the
	// ResourceDataOrError needs to be type asserted to the appropriate type
	// for the resource being watched.
	//
	// In the latter case, this callback will be invoked with a non-nil error
	// value in ResourceDataOrError.
	//
	// Watcher is expected to use the most recent value passed to
	// OnResourceChanged(), regardless of whether that's a ResourceData or an
	// error i.e., if the watcher is given an error via OnResourceChanged(),
	// that means it should stop using any previously delivered resource.
	//
	// It is invoked under different error conditions including but not
	// limited to the following:
	//      - authority mentioned in the resource is not found
	//      - resource name parsing error
	//      - resource validation error (if resource is not cached)
	//      - ADS stream failure (if resource is not cached)
	//      - connection failure (if resource is not cached)

	// after a resource has been received (i.e. we already have a cached
	// resource) that should not modify the watcherâ€™s use of that resource but
	// that may be useful information about the ambient state of the XdsClient.
	// In particular, the watcher should NOT stop using the previously seen
	// resource, and the XdsClient will NOT remove the resource from its cache.
	// However, the error message may be useful as additional context to
	// include in errors that are being generated for other reasons.
	//
	// If resource is already cached, it is invoked under different error
	// conditions including but not limited to the following:
	//      - resource validation error
	//      - ADS stream failure
	//      - connection failure
