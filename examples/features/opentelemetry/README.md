# OpenTelemetry

This example demonstrates how to configure OpenTelemetry on a gRPC client
and server, showcasing the telemetry data it produces for RPC interactions.

## Try it

1.  **Run the gRPC Server:**

    ```
    go run server/main.go
    ```

    * This starts the gRPC server, which also exposes a Prometheus
        metrics endpoint.

2.  **Run the gRPC Client:**

    ```
    go run client/main.go
    ```

    * This starts the gRPC client, which continuously makes RPC calls
        to the server.
    * The client also exposes a Prometheus metrics endpoint.

3.  **View Prometheus Metrics:**

    * **Server Metrics:**

        ```
        curl localhost:9464/metrics
        ```

        * This command retrieves the Prometheus metrics exposed by the
            gRPC server.

    * **Client Metrics:**

        ```
        curl localhost:9465/metrics
        ```

        * This command retrieves the Prometheus metrics exposed by the
            gRPC client.

## Explanation

* **Continuous RPC Calls:** The client continuously makes RPC calls to
    the server, generating telemetry data.
* **Prometheus Exporter:** Both the client and server are configured
    with a Prometheus exporter, which listens and provides metrics.
    * The server's Prometheus endpoint defaults to `:9464`.
    * The client's Prometheus endpoint defaults to `:9465`.
* **OpenTelemetry Configuration:** OpenTelemetry is configured on both
    the client and server to capture metrics and traces.
* **Metrics Export:** The OpenTelemetry configuration exports metrics to
    the Prometheus exporter.
* **Viewing Metrics:** By curling the exposed Prometheus ports, you can
    view the metrics recorded by the client and server. These metrics
    provide insights into the performance and behavior of the gRPC calls.

## Adding Trace Visualization (Optional)

To visualize traces, you'll need to set up an OTLP Collector and a trace
backend like Jaeger. The client and server code are already configured
to send trace data via OTLP.

1.  **Start Jaeger (or another trace backend):**

    * **Local Jaeger (No Docker):**

        ```
        ./jaeger-all-in-one --collector.otlp.enabled
        ```

    * **Docker Jaeger:**

        ```
        docker run -d -p 16686:16686 -p 14268:14268 \
        jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
        ```

2.  **Start the OpenTelemetry Collector:**

    * **Local Collector:**
        * Install the `otelcol-contrib` binary.
        * Create a configuration file (e.g., `collector-config.yaml`)
            specifying:
            * An OTLP receiver (to receive traces from your client and server).
            * A batch processor (recommended for performance).
            * A Jaeger exporter (to send traces to Jaeger).
        * Run the collector: `./otelcol-contrib --config collector-config.yaml`
    * **Docker Collector:**
        * Create a configuration file (e.g., `collector-config.yaml`)
            specifying the same components as above.
        * Run the collector with Docker, mounting your configuration
            file:

            ```
            docker run -d -p 4317:4317 -p 4318:4318 \
            -v $(pwd)/collector-config.yaml:/etc/otel-collector-config.yaml \
            --name otel-collector otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:latest \
            --config=/etc/otel-collector-config.yaml
            ```

3.  **View Traces in Jaeger UI:**

    * Open `http://localhost:16686` in your browser.
    * Search for traces to visualize the RPC call flow. The traces will
        be generated by the client and server, sent to the collector,
        and then displayed by Jaeger.
