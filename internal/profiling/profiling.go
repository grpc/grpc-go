// Package profiling contains two logical components: buffer.go and
// profiling.go. The former implements a circular buffer (a.k.a. ring buffer)
// in a lock-free manner using atomics. This ring buffer is used by
// profiling.go to store various statistics. For example, StreamStats is a
// circular buffer of Stat objects, each of which is comprised of Timers.
//
// This abstraction is designed to accommodate more stats in the future; for
// example, if one wants to profile the load balancing layer, which is
// independent of RPC queries, a separate CircularBuffer can be used.
//
// Note that the circular buffer simply takes any interface{}. In the future,
// more types of measurements (such as the number of memory allocations) could
// be measured, which might require a different type of object being pushed
// into the circular buffer.
