# protoc-gen-go-grpc

This tool generates Go language bindings of `service`s in protobuf definition
files for gRPC.  For usage information, please see our [quick start
guide](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/).

By default, to register services using the methods generated by this tool, the
services must embed the corresponding `Unimplemented<ServiceName>Server`.  This
is a behavior change from the grpc code generator previously included with
`protoc-gen-go`.  To restore this behavior, set the option
`requireUnimplementedServers=false`.  E.g.:

```
  protoc --go-grpc_out=requireUnimplementedServers=false[,other options...]:. \
```
